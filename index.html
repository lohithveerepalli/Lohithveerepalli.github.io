<section class="about-me" id="about">
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        I am a recent graduate from University of Alabama at Birmingham, majoring in Computer Science and Math (with honors). I have an immense passion for Software Development, having worked on numerous individual and team projects within the past 5 years. I constantly strive to learn new tools and technologies while sharpening the fundamentals of my core field of studies such as problem solving and software engineering. I like solving real-life challenges and assessing the existing systems, imagining how they can be improved. I value the importance of learning relevant topics that could be beneficial for my overall development. My other interests include Graphic Design, Formula 1, and an intense enthusiasm for emerging technologies. One day, I wish to create systems that solve large-scale societal problems such as poverty in my home country India and all over the world.

    <div class="job">
        <h3>Learning Research Lab</h3>
        <p>Dr. Leland Hartwell ⋅ August 2022 - December 2022</p>
        <p>
            Under the guidance of Dr. Hartwell, I explored the concept of “doing” science rather than simply reading about it. I explored the phenomenon of visual cognition by conducting behavioral experiments that would derive some meaning from our visual experience. Additionally, I learned to create behavioral experiments using the jsPsych library and worked towards creating a streamlined system of quick experiment generation through templates. Further research can lead to insights into how human cognition works and how we can replicate that for artificial systems and computer vision challenges.

        <p>
            Part of the student collaboration team at NASA Psyche Mission. Involved in developing and maintaining software including Psyche mobile apps and website. Assisted the Senior Capstone teams and Psyche Inspired students. Engaged in public outreach programs.

        <h3>Misinformation Research Lab</h3>
        <p>Unit for Data Science ⋅ August 2021 - December 2021</p>
        <p>
            Under the guidance of Director Michael Simeone, I worked with Twitter and Parler data related to the 2021 US Capitol attack, implementing a dashboard to visualize the characteristics and influence of misinformation spread and expanding my knowledge of Python’s data science libraries. The lab’s aim was not to classify the information as true or false but to produce tools for understanding the salient features of misinformation. This project will benefit further misinformation research for practical implementations by policymakers.
